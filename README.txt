-ABOUT-
For this year's final project, we've designed a more challenging, console-based
version of the classic 80's arcade game Tetris. However, there's a twist--all of
the blocks in Pentris are composed of five styles rather than the traditionalist 
four. How will you ever rack up those sick multi-line combos now? The blocks just 
don't stack up.

But never fear. We give the players an edge in Pentris. With our Java console display,
hearkening back to the very first versions of the game (there's probably something 
just like this project on Alexey Pajitnov's desktop,) we present a minimalistic view 
of the game that's extremely easy on the eyes. Lines clear and blocks fall just as 
they do in other versions, encouraging an easy transition from previous incarnations 
of Tetris to this one. In addition, several levels of varying difficulty are featured
such as to ensure an experience where you'll never get bored. There's also a score 
counter, allowing one to achieve new high scores and to compare them with friends.

This is the new face of Tetris. This is Pentris.

-CONTROLS-
Note: You must hit enter after each command.

W - Rotate block
A - Move block left
S - Move block down one tile
D - Move block right

' '(space) - Moves block down to the lowest possible position

-PROGRAMMER NOTES-
Unfortunately, implementation of JavaFX into this game was not included(must buy DLC). 
It would not take very long to convert the strings to images on JavaFX.

A timer couldn't be used for the blocks to drop, so every 2 command inputs the block
moves down 1 block. 

The majority of bugs had to do with referencing arrays that were not supposed to be referenced.
After hours of testing and many sleepless nights, this version is 100% functional and
very challenging indeed.
