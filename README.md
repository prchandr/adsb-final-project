Tetris. Tetris with size five blocks. This totally revolutionary program will completely reshape the way you look at the classic 80's game, with an entirely new system of play designed to be much more difficult than the original. Power-ups curated to fit the style of play. A tiered system of difficulty. A minimalistic approach to a game often overburdened with special effects.
This is Pentris.

lmao this has to be one of the most pretentious things I've ever written
