Pentris
Group Members: Prem Chandrasekar, Brennan Winer, Matt Morris

For this year's final project, we've designed a more challenging, console-based version of the classic 80's arcade game Tetris. However, there's a twist--all of the blocks in Pentris are composed of five styles rather than the traditionalist four. How will you ever rack up those sick multi-line combos now? The blocks just don't stack up.

But never fear. We give the players an edge in Pentris. With our Java console display, hearkening back to the very first versions of the game (there's probably something just like this project on Alexey Pajitnov's desktop,) we present a minimalistic view of the game that's extremely easy on the eyes. Lines clear and blocks fall just as they do in other versions, encouraging an easy transition from previous incarnations of Tetris to this one. In addition, several levels of varying difficulty are featured such as to ensure an experience where you'll never get bored. There's also a score counter, allowing one to achieve new high scores and to compare them with friends.   
This is the new face of Tetris. This is Pentris.
